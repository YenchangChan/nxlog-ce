[desc="Provides a Perl API and supports calling a Perl subroutine during processing"]
==== Perl (xm_perl)

// tag::about[]

The http://perl.org[Perl programming language] is widely used for log
processing and comes with a broad set of modules bundled or available
from http://cpan.org[CPAN]. Code can be written more quickly in Perl
than in C, and code execution is safer because exceptions (croak/die)
are handled properly and will only result in an unfinished attempt at
log processing rather than taking down the whole {productName}
process.

// end::about[]

While the <<ref-lang,{ProductName} language>> is already a powerful
framework, it is not intended to be a fully featured programming
language and does not provide lists, arrays, hashes, and other features
available in many high-level languages. With this module, Perl can be
used to process event data via a built-in Perl interpreter.

The Perl interpreter is only loaded if the module is declared in the
configuration. The module will parse the file specified in the
<<xm_perl_config_perlcode,PerlCode>> directive when {productName}
starts the module. This file should contain one or more methods
which can be called from the <<config_module_exec,Exec>> directive of
any module that will use Perl for log processing. See the
<<xm_perl_config_examples,example>> below.

To access event data, the Log::Nxlog module must be included, which provides
the following methods.

// tag::log_methods[]

log_debug(msg):: Send the message _msg_ to the internal logger on
  DEBUG log level. This method does the same as the
  <<core_proc_log_debug,log_debug()>> procedure in {productName}.
log_info(msg):: Send the message _msg_ to the internal logger on INFO
  log level. This method does the same as the
  <<core_proc_log_info,log_info()>> procedure in {productName}.
log_warning(msg):: Send the message _msg_ to the internal logger on
  WARNING log level. This method does the same as the
  <<core_proc_log_warning,log_warning()>> procedure in {productName}.
log_error(msg):: Send the message _msg_ to the internal logger on
  ERROR log level. This method does the same as the
  <<core_proc_log_error,log_error()>> procedure in {productName}.

// end::log_methods[]

delete_field(event, key):: Delete the value associated with the field
  named _key_.
field_names(event):: Return a list of the field names contained in the
  event data. This method can be used to iterate over all of the
  fields.
field_type(event, key):: Return a string representing the type of the
  value associated with the field named _key_.
get_field(event, key):: Retrieve the value associated with the field
  named _key_. This method returns a scalar value if the key exists
  and the value is defined, otherwise it returns undef.
set_field_boolean(event, key, value):: Set the boolean value in the
  field named _key_.
set_field_integer(event, key, value):: Set the integer value in the
  field named _key_.
set_field_string(event, key, value):: Set the string value in the
  field named _key_.

// tag::pod[]

`Nxlog.pm`. The documentation can be read with `perldoc Log::Nxlog`.

[[xm_perl_config]]
===== Configuration

The _xm_perl_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[xm_perl_config_perlcode]]
PerlCode:: This mandatory directive expects a file containing valid
  Perl code. This file is read and parsed by the Perl
  interpreter. Methods defined in this file can be called with the
  <<xm_perl_proc_call,call()>> procedure.

[[xm_perl_config_examples]]
===== Examples

[[xm_perl_example1]]
.Using the built-in Perl interpreter
====
In this example, logs are parsed as Syslog and then are passed to
a Perl method which does a GeoIP lookup on the source address of the
incoming message.
